Created a web mapping application inspired by that of Google Maps that uses Rastering and A* Search methods. Users can navigate the city of Berkeley and select any two locations in the map and this program will find the shortest and optimal route to get from one location to the other.

Because of the use of rastering, nodes, and trees, the user can also zoom in and out in order to find key locations such as restaurants, stores, roads, and trails.

Users can also search for these key locations through the search bar which has an auto-complete feature that will allow for more efficient searching.
